        "Bot": "Thank you for providing me with the necessary context! To answer your follow-up question, I have analyzed the carbon footprint of sedans and trucks based on the categories you provided. Here's the result:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\"Car_Type\": \"Sedan\", \"Carbon_Footprint_kgCO2_per_Mile\": 7},\n    {\"Car_Type\": \"Truck\", \"Carbon_Footprint_kgCO2_per_Mile\": 15}\n]\n```\n\nIn this output, the first item in the list represents a sedan, and the second item represents a truck. The \"Carbon_Footprint_kgCO2_per_Mile\" value for each category is the estimated amount of CO2 emissions per mile driven, based on the type of fuel used and the vehicle's overall efficiency.\n\nI hope this helps answer your question! Let me know if you have any further queries."
